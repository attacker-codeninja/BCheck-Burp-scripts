This repository contains a small collection of Burp Suite BCheck scripts developed by YesWeHack.
Our blog post "*[PimpMyBurp #9 â€“ Use BCheck to improve vulnerability scanning](https://blog.yeswehack.com/yeswerhackers/pimpmyburp-9-use-bcheck-to-improve-vulnerability-scanning/)*" explains some of the BCheck in this repository in more detail and how you can use BCheck in your bug bounty hunt to detect security issues in your targets.
